<h2> Description</h2> 
<p> Appam is a popular breakfast recipe in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Made from fermented batter of rice, udad dal, and coconut, these spongy hoppers are typically eaten with curries, chutneys, or coconut milk. </p>

<h2> Ingredients </h2>
<ul> 
    <li> 1 cup raw rice </li>
    <li> 1/4 cup cooked rice </li>
    <li> 1/4 cup grated coconut</li>
    <li> 1/2 teaspoon active dry yeast or 1/4 cup fermented appam batter (to aid fermentation)</li>
    <li> 1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
    <li> 1/2 cup coconut milk</li>
    <li> Salt to taste</li>
    <li> Water, as needed</li>
</ul>

<h2> Instructions </h2>
<ol> 
    <li>Wash the raw rice thoroughly and soak it in water for about 4-6 hours or overnight. </li>
    <li> Drain the soaked rice and grind it along with cooked rice, grated coconut, and a little water to a smooth batter. The batter should be of pouring consistency. Not too thick nor too thin.</li>
    <li>Mix the yeast with sugar in a little warm water and let it sit for 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy. </li>
    <li>Add the frothy yeast mixture to the batter and mix well.</li>
    <li>Allow the batter to ferment for about 6-8 hours or overnight. If you have previously fermented appam batter, you can use it as a starter to quicken the fermentation process.</li>
    <li> Add coconut milk to the batter. Adjust the consistency with water if needed.</li>
    <li>Add salt to taste and mix well. </li>
    <li>Heat an appam pan or a non-stick skillet over medium heat. </li>
    <li>Pour a ladle of batter into the center of the pan and quickly swirl the pan to spread the batter in a thin layer, leaving a slightly thicker center.</li>
    <li>Cover the pan with a lid and cook until the edges become crisp and golden, and the center is soft and spongy.</li>
    <li>Repeat the process with the remaining batter.</li>
    <li> Serve the appams hot with coconut milk, or any curry of your choice.</li>
</ol>
